 Went well
- I like that backend team offered to help with frontend  ( Anonymous, 5 Up Votes  ) 
- Everyone has been showing up to do their work assigned to them. There has also been good communication in terms of people know what is going on. The many meetings has updated everyone to a point where even if there is communication we are still semi-on the same page  ( Anonymous, 4 Up Votes  )

 To improve
